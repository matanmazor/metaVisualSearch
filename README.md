[Experiment 2 (color and orientation)](https://matanmazor.github.io/metaVisualSearch/experiments/demos/Experiment3/)

[Experiment 3 (Alphabet of the Magi)](https://matanmazor.github.io/metaVisualSearch/experiments/demos/Experiment2/)

[Experiment 5 (Visual search asymmetries)](https://matanmazor.github.io/metaVisualSearch/experiments/demos/Experiment5/)

[Experiment 6 (Target-distractor similarity)](https://matanmazor.github.io/metaVisualSearch/experiments/demos/Experiment6/)

Note: experiments in the data and experiments subdirectories are presented in the order in which they were run, with 1 and 2 being the two exploratory experiments, and 3 and 4 the pre-registered ones. In the paper we group exploratory experiments with their pre-registered extensions, such that Experiment 3 is presented as Experiment 2, and Experiment 3 is presented as Experiment 3.
